we use pnpm as the package manager, not npm
Always write clear, well executed code that achieves the users instructions without massive sweeping code changes (althought sometimes this may be necessary)
We always use the responses API from openai

Keep in mind we are using Next.JS 15 which has some breakgin changes like for this error
Type '{ slug: string[]; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Promise<any>': then, catch, finally, [Symbol.toStringTag]

we actually need to do the following:

type Params = Promise<{ slug: string[] }>

export default async function Page({ params }: { params: Params }) {  
  const { slug } = await params
}
